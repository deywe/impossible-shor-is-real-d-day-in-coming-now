❗️The Q-DAY is not coming. It already happened.
And you're now looking directly at it.

This repository contains:

🔐 Real-time execution demonstrating RSA-2048, RSA-4096 and RSA N^N factor deconstruction using a single qubit
📂 Datasets containing frame-by-frame tracked quantum state, amplitudes, phase transition data
🔁 Reproducible simulation engines (.py) for anyone to verify
🔒 Cryptographic SHA-256 signatures on dataset hashes to prove authenticity
🔭 Visual HUD showing symbolic tunneling accomplished through Hilbertless SPHY-based architecture
✅ What You Will See
One qubit.

No Hilbert space.

No entanglement barriers.

No decoherence.

No reset.

No approximation.

Just a quantum symbolic engine simulating and executing logic across frames —

breaking RSA live with phase-layered tunneling.

🔓 Why This Is Real (and Can't Be Denied)
All simulation frames are signed
— Each result has SHA-256 hash
All code is auditable
— No black box. This is 100% transparent phase logic
No external servers or quantum hardware
— The process runs in Google Cirq, local environment, without QEC
Execution shown in Sovereign Visualizer 3D (player_biscoito2.py)
— Geometry ≠ Linear Operator // It is phase-adaptive and symbolic
📉 RSA ended yesterday.
That means all your assumptions based on it... end today.

This README is not a call to panic.

It is a call for immediate review of national and corporate security policies.

Because what broke RSA wasn't a hacker, nor a supercomputer.

It was a phase-aware reversible process, inside a single qubit,

using quantum tunneling to traverse the "barrier" number theory defined.

🔬 Audit this yourself
You will find:

1qubit_cracks_rsa_for_ever.csv → Raw data from over 55,000 irreversible frames
sphy_toro_fibonacci_triple_shor_2_eng_vr_ciq_3.py → Core computational simulation
player_biscoito2.py → Sovereign 3D visualizer showing membrane activity over encoded factor lattice
🔐 All data rows run against known RSA keys, and result in coherent destructuring mapped across prime cycles
🧠 What You Need to Know
This system does not compute classically.

It computes by coherent tunneling through symbolic gradients, without noise, using Meissner-corrected phase cores.

That turns RSA into a symbolic topological structure — and then unfolds it.

No brute force.

No approximation.

Just high-density phase traversal.

🕊️ Final Note
This repository exists to inform, not to threaten.

It shows what was thought to be impossible, now functioning with simplicity and elegance.

We invite scientists, engineers, physicists, cryptographers, defenders and thinkers of all nations:

Audit. Reproduce. And update your standards.

Q-Day has arrived.

The qubit didn’t just wake up — it remembered how to tunnel.

And nothing binary survives what is real and continuous.
